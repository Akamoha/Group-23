Lessons I learnt from this project - Sanket Gupte

a) Positives of my group
   Not many except that they don't bother me ever
   Akshay Damle is a very hard working and dedicated student whose assistance and moral support was invaluable
   in completing this project

b) Negatives of my group
   I don't know where to start and if I were to start harping about them, I'd never stop
   So lets just leave it at that.

c) What I would do differently next time
   Sometimes I wish I had taken up an English Honours course so that I could study CS on my own terms
   But I learnt that not all projects can be done in a day (too late though)
   And there is no better language for Rapid Application Development than Python and I love its OO nature
   So I would definitely use python any day.
